# ME227: Vehicle Dynamics & Control

This was hands down the best class I have taken at Stanford. The drifting assignment was one of the cooler ones (especially
since we got hands-on experience at LeMans Racing in Fremont as well) so I figured I'd throw it in.
Pole Position (our team name) contains the project spec, code, and report. The team consisted of Ryan Lee, Tatiana Mowry, Megan Rowe, as well as myself. Miss y'all!
